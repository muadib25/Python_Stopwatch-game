# Python_Stopwatch-game
A stopwatch game in python, where the player tries to stop the watch at whole seconds. 

The score counter at the top-right corner counts the overall and successful attempts. I've also implemented a 'Flicker' toggle 
button that flashes the framebuffer in an attempt to simulate the flickering of an LCD screen. Heh...

The game was done during a Coursera Interactive Python course via Rice University and runs at the moment via the Codeskulptor.org 
page. 


To view the code in action and/or play the game just go to www.codeskulptor.org and paste the code on the left window, followed by 
clicking on the 'Play' button located on the panel's top-left side.

Or you can just visit this page: http://www.codeskulptor.org/#user43_jMCpY9txm1_0.py

Have fun!
